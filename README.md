## Vaccine simulation

*This is a personal/university project and it is by no means to be taken as a guideline for governmental optimal policy. Oh, and get vaxxed if you have not.*

This repository contains a jupyter notebook and relative data with which I tried to answer in February 2021 - beginning of vaccination campaign in Italy - whether it would have been more effective to vaccinate young people or elderly people. The model for the epidemic spreading it is taken from [[1]](#1).

To model the various age-specific infection rates I assumed a linear model depending on the average number of contacts per individual of each age category. I used [[2]](#2) and [[3]](#3) to model the contact matrix.

The simulation indeed predicted that administering the vaccine to elder people first is a wise choice in terms of saved human lives.
